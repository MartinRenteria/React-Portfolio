      <p className="text-light pl-3 ml-3">
        Bilingual social services professional looking to expand into the
        Technology field. Through consistent self-learning and drive to be
        on top of the latest technologies and skills needed within the
        industry, I am looking to establish my presence in the ever-growing
        tech world. Having earned my Bachelors in Psychology and gaining
        experience within the field's discipline, I learned interpersonal
        communication and working in teams that will no doubt assist me in
        serving others within the world of technology. </p>
       <p> Ever since I was young, all I ever wanted to do was to help people.
        That mindset has not changed. Now, I continue to build my career
        with the motivation and determination to do just that. By combining
        my two passions, I believe i can reach and assist individuals using
        the knowledge I have gained through Technology and Psychology.</p>
